# Automatic_Files_Organizer
Organize your files automatically. Choose any folder you want to be organized and save your time! 

#The language used here is Python!

Run it on your interprter, choose any folders like 'Downloads', 'Desktop', etc. which are always pretty messy and would appretiate some cleaning and organization.


#If you want to make it an clickable .exe app then in your terminal where your code resides:
  1. pip install pyinstaller
  2. pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole folder_organizer_gui.py
  3. Enjoy!!
